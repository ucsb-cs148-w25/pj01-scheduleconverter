# Team Contributions Summary

## Nathan

Nathan contributed significantly through code improvements, notably by correcting licenses, removing redundant tests, and enhancing functionality to enable multiple section additions simultaneously. He actively led multiple standup meetings, advanced various lab deliverables, and directed the creation of deployment documentation. Nathan was instrumental in shaping the project's direction, identifying and debugging critical issues, and conducting comprehensive research into UCSB API capabilities.

## Bharat

Bharat implemented key features enabling users to export schedules as ICS files compatible with common calendar software. He laid essential groundwork for interactions with Google Calendar, successfully prototyping event additions. Bharat also established the initial Google OAuth functionality for UCSB email account-specific sign-ins, greatly enhancing the website's integration capabilities.

## Gio

Gio significantly improved user experience by adding a dark mode feature with persistent user settings. He initiated a project port to Vite for enhanced security and future feature compatibility, deployed the production version on Netlify, refined documentation for self-hosting, fixed numerous UI bugs, and organized standup summaries on a rotating schedule.

## Abby

Abby focused on refining core functionality, addressing timezone-based event discrepancies, implementing color selection for events, developing a course deletion function, writing unit tests, and making UI design enhancements. Additionally, she contributed to developing a dropdown course search feature. Abby effectively led several standups and made notable progress on documentation.

## Yungong

Yungong was instrumental in backend improvements, notably by creating a mock database, resolving critical API connectivity issues, and writing integration tests. He also contributed significantly to project documentation by producing the MVP videos and crafting the user manual.

## Christian

Christian made essential API contributions, setting up robust UCSB API interactions for retrieving course offerings and schedules per quarter. He implemented an intuitive quarter and class selection dropdown interface, led the second project retrospective, and facilitated standup meetings per the rotation schedule.

## Ashton

Ashton spearheaded initial app development, successfully connecting the frontend to Google OAuth and Google Calendar APIs. Leveraging contributions from Bharat and Yungong, he developed the MVP for class integration into Google Calendar. Post-MVP, Ashton refined class display methods and addressed minor interface issues, including UI compatibility with dark mode. He also led the group's first retrospective and actively conducted standup meetings.

## Commit Accuracy and Explanation

The Contributors graph is accurate. Commit counts reflect individual member activities fairly, aligned closely with documented contributions. While commit volume and line counts vary, these variations reflect the diverse roles and responsibilities undertaken by each member. It should also be noted that some team members emphasized conceptualizing, brainstorming project ideas, and providing leadership in meetings and retrospectives, which are crucial contributions not necessarily reflected in commit data. Overall, commit data accurately reflects contributions, but it does not fully encapsulate the critical roles played by members focused more heavily on leadership and idea development.
