Hi, I am Yungong (Michale) Wang. I am a third year student. I am very excited to take this class and start this group project. For this project, I think it is a smart idea to create google calender form of GOLD course schedule, as it will be very convenient in reminding us which time to take course. For the ideas, I think the API for GOLD might be used. We might need to extract some information from user's account and then design an algorithm or function to construct and formulate the corresponding google calender. I hope everything going smooth!
