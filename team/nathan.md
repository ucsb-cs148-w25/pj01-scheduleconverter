# Nathan Alexander
## About Me:
My name is Nathaniel Alexander but I prefer to go by Nathan. I am a first year transfer in my Junior year in Computer Science. I haven't really taken a class like this before but I am excited to work together in a group for a project like this.

### Initial Ideas:
My initial ideas for this project were pretty simple. Taking the schedule of a student and translating it into a Google Calendar is pretty useful. While stuff like this has been done before, there is lots of room to expand, like sending notifications or displaying other useful information the student may need.
