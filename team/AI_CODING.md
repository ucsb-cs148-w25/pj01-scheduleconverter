- Used AI: ChatGPT
- Outcome: A summary of the key points on the things people liked and suggestions and improvements for our team.
- how useful this tool was / potentially could be for your coding effort going forward
    - ChatGPT does a good job in summarizing great amount of material into one. It reduces the repetitiveness of the content that a human would need to read on their own. Moving forawrd, ChatGPT would be useful if we are to create a summary of our ideas. For example, if we want to do a user story, we could let each of our members write one and let ChatGPT summarize and combine all for us.
- what steps you needed to (or couldn’t) take to ensure that the AI output was correct, understandable, and fair use
    - To make sure that the output was correct, we would have to read all the content in the file I plugged in, which loses the point of letting the AI summarize it. Therefore, it would be more beneficial to read through the response and look for sketchy to simply disregard since this summary should be in content that we are all familiar with.

- Used AI: ChatGPT
- Outcome: Some suggestion about which test-lib should we use, some common testing functions and the way to use them, and how to install the config and dependencies for the test-lib.
- how useful this tool was / potentially could be for your coding effort going forward
    - ChatGPT really provides me with many information and materials about coding. For example, if I need to complete a certain task that may use certain function, but I do not know which lib or repo should I import, it can provide me with some really good choice. In addition, though we can go to read the documentation for the function and lib, ChatGPT can give a really quick and easy summary for you, which is easier for us to understand. This can help you familiarize coding faster when you first learn a new language or framework.
- what steps you needed to (or couldn’t) take to ensure that the AI output was correct, understandable, and fair use
    - The best way to make sure whether the AI output is correct is actually following the step it generated. However, this does not means that we should just copy and paste the code that ChatGPT writes for us. I think we should first try to understand the function and format that ChatGPT provides with us, and think about it if they are reasonable, and then try to use them on our local host for our own word and modification for our purpose. It is better and important to use the AI output cautiously.
