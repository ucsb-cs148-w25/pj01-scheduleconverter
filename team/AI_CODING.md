- Used AI: ChatGPT
- Outcome: A summary of the key points on the things people liked and suggestions and improvements for our team.
- how useful this tool was / potentially could be for your coding effort going forward
    - ChatGPT does a good job in summarizing great amount of material into one. It reduces the repetitiveness of the content that a human would need to read on their own. Moving forawrd, ChatGPT would be useful if we are to create a summary of our ideas. For example, if we want to do a user story, we could let each of our members write one and let ChatGPT summarize and combine all for us.
- what steps you needed to (or couldnâ€™t) take to ensure that the AI output was correct, understandable, and fair use
    - To make sure that the output was correct, we would have to read all the content in the file I plugged in, which loses the point of letting the AI summarize it. Therefore, it would be more beneficial to read through the response and look for sketchy to simply disregard since this summary should be in content that we are all familiar with.
