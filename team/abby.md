Hi, I'm Abby. I'm a third year Computer Science major.
For this project, I imagine having the final project as a webpage that will allow input and output. The input would be the GOLD schedule (in some form that is plausible: text, image, or even simply account if we have to access) and the output being to auto insert the events on Google Calander, which we might need some API to do. I'm not too sure on how to accomplish this by technology and I think there should be a lot to explore.
