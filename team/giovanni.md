### About Me
I am a 3rd year transfer CS student, I have experience in Python, C++, but I am enthusiastic to learn whatever technology stack we decide on working with.

### Project Ideas
* letting the user set notification preferences
* making events (classes) recur until the end of the quarter
* include location for each class
* let the user choose which calendar to put classes on
