# Date of Retrospective: 03/05/25

* Led by: 
* Present: Giovanni Long, Abby Fan, Ashton Wong, Bharat Saiju, Christian Lee, Nathan Alexander, Yungong Wang
* Absent: n/a

## Action item

* Goal: Checking and making sure that tasks, in the lab or our project, are in progress
* Experiment: Check that every member has a task in the "In Progress" column on the Kanban board.
* Measurement: The number of tasks a member has that are not in the "Done" column

## Top 3 Bullets

* Checking and making sure that tasks, in the lab or our project, are in progress
* Stop Procrastinating and be proactive in completing tasks
* Continue the good progress towards the final deployment

## Retro Assessment

* In this retro, we used the start/stop/continue outline for our discussion. In our Slack channel, each member sends a set of 3 start/stop/continue items they want to work on. After everyone sends their message, we organize and come up with the top 3 items that we will move on as a team.
* The retro progressed smoothly and each member is used to this structure as this is the last retro for this course.
* For the next retro leader, I think it would be nice to keep on to this outline as it is easy to follow and easy to organize.

## Experiment/Change

* Description: In this experiment, we want to make sure that each member has a task under "In Progress" so that we know the progress of each member and make sure that all of us are on track.
* Assessment: As a team, we would check if each member has an event that is in progress.
* Decision Going Forward: As a team, we check and decide if each member has a task in progress or not by more actively utilizing the Kanban Board

The outcome of this experiment is that each member is more active in finding and checking for tasks that we are completing. We should continue this progress till the Code Freeze so that we can get the most out of the project in time.
