## Action item

* Goal: Start more active communication on slack, whether that's roadblocks, pivots, progress, or being late to class.
* Experiment: Send a message to the slack every day documenting progress, even if there is none.
* Measurement: Number of texts / more alignment

## Top 3 Bullets

* Start more active communication on slack, whether that's roadblocks, pivots, progress, or being late to class
* Start being more proactive about finishing work
* Start having more well-defined goals

## Retro Assessment

* We had everybody send their start/stop/continues into the slack and then talked about them, naming our top 3 bullet points. We then picked our top one and made an experiment to aid it.
* I think the retro went well, everybody had very similar ideas of things we could work on and saying them explicitly and creating an experiment helped a lot.
* Be very concise and offer opinion when none is given.

## Experiment/Change

* Description: Our experiment was to have everybody send a message to the slack every day
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?

We determined having everyone send a message in the slack every day was successful in boosting team collaboration and productivity. 
We saw more tasks getting done while being more efficient, namley less responsibility colliions and less responsibility gaps.

This focus on communication has also carried over to our daily scrums and meetings, with responsibilities being delegated more proactively.
