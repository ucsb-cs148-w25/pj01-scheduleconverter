# Date of Retrospective: 01/24/25

* Led by: Ashton Wong
* Present: Giovanni Long, Abby Fan, Ashton Wong, Bharat Saiju, Christian Lee, Nathan Alexander, Yungong Wang
* Absent: n/a

## Action item

* Goal: Start more active communication on slack, whether that's roadblocks, pivots, progress, or being late to class.
* Experiment: Send a message to the slack every day documenting progress, even if there is none.
* Measurement: Number of texts / more alignment

## Top 3 Bullets

* Start more active communication on slack, whether that's roadblocks, pivots, progress, or being late to class
* Start being more proactive about finishing work
* Start having more well-defined goals

## Retro Assessment

* We had everybody send their start/stop/continues into the slack and then talked about them, naming our top 3 bullet points. We then picked our top one and made an experiment to aid it.
* I think the retro went well, everybody had very similar ideas of things we could work on and saying them explicitly and creating an experiment helped a lot.
* Be very concise and offer opinion when none is given.

## Experiment/Change

* Description: Our experiment was to have everybody send a message to the slack every day
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?
