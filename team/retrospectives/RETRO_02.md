* Led by: Christian Lee
* Present: Giovanni Long, Abby Fan, Ashton Wong, Bharat Saiju, Christian Lee, Nathan Alexander, Yungong Wang
* Absent: n/a

## Action item

* Goal: Start utilizing the Kanban board so that everybody knows what everybody else is working on.
* Experiment: Move at least one issue through the Kanban board process to done per week, regardless of what the lab assignment is.
* Measurement: Number of issues resolved using the Kanban board.

## Top 3 Bullets

* Start utilizing Kanban board more to help us communicate and integrate our work.
* Stop overlapping the same tasks.
* Continue to meet lab deadlines and delegating tasks.

## Retro Assessment

* We had everybody send their start/stop/continues into the slack and then talked about them. We then chose the top three most repeated points.
* The retro went well. Everybody on the team had similar visions on what we can improve and it was easy to diagnose our weaknesses and thus our strengths.
* Make sure to thoroughly consider everybody's points.

## Experiment/Change

* Description: Our experiment based on this retro is to have everybody add/move an item through the kanban board every week
* Assessment: As a team, we decided that actually utilizing the Kanban board as a means of communication and task delegation would decrease the number of people overlapping tasks. Thus we clearly knew who was working on what and where they are in the process.
* Decision Going Forward: Actually utilizing the Kanban board

The outcome of this experiment is that it has also made our standups and meetings more efficient as we immediately know who was working on what. It reduces miscommunication within the team by a lot. And as such, we conclude to continue this practice.
