## About Me:
Hi, my name's Ashton Wong, and I'm a 4th year CS Major. I've already taken CS156 and am concurrently taking CS189, so I have at least a little experience with agile methodologies.

## Initial Ideas:
My initial thoughts were that the basic idea of this project is pretty simple but can be expanded. I was thinking that we could make an app like the old GoGaucho that's an all in one hub for student needs, and then have the calendar converter be a function of that app.
