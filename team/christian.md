# About Me
I'm a third-year from Orange County, CA. I enjoy running, swimming, and bowling. This is my first CS project and I'm excited to finally work on something with practical use.
# Ideas
I have very little experience outside of classroom labs, thus I don't really have a preference when it comes to different stacks. I was definitely thinking more towards a web app.
