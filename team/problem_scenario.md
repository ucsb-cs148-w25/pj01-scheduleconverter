# Problem Scenario
Kathy Goldberg is a second-year student at UCSB.  With an extremely busy academic and personal life, it is essential that Kathy has a well-organized schedule. Thus, Kathy utilizes Google Calendar that combines both her lecture and personal schedules. When her lecture schedule is finalized every quarter on GOLD, she must do the aggravating and time-consuming task of manually making events on her Google Calendar for lecture times and office hours for each class she's taking. She also needs to manually add the date, time, and location for each of these events. Every quarter, this seemingly mindless task strips an hour out of her busy schedule. Kathy wishes there was simply a button that could convert the GOLD weekly schedule onto her Google Calendar.
