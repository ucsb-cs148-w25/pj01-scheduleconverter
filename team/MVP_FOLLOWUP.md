# Response Actions
1. We will be enhancing the UI features of our project (adding color themes and different modes) to enhance visual experience of users.
2. We will allow users to select classes instead of verifying their identity to increase security of the project
3. We will add functionalities to allow custom choice of classes in selected quarters
4. We will be adding dropdowns and search for courses instead of automatic addition from perm number


# Next Steps
- We will be looking into the frontend of our app and brainstorm creative features to enhance UI.
- We will be looking into accessible UCSB APIs to find out how to add the information of courses into a dropdown search.
